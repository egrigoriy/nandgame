Thought process: 

Control Unit

In addition to the ALU instructions, the computer should also support data instructions. 
In a data instruction, the instruction value is directly written to the A register.

Create a control unit which execute either a data- or ALU instruction, depending on the high-bit of the instruction I:

Bit 15
0	Data instruction
1	ALU instruction

ALU instruction
For ALU instructions, the output should be as specified in the previous level.
R is the result of the ALU operation.

Data instruction
For a data instruction, the output R should be the I input, and destination should be the A register. 
I.e. a should be 1 and d, a*, and j flags should be 0.

===
Instruction Bit 15 selects between I (when bit-15=0) and ALU instruction (when bit-15=1).
So, we need splitter, ALU and SELECT16.

However, in case of data instuction Control Unit output a should be 1 and d, a*, and j flags should be 0.
So bit-15 selects between ALU instruction output a, d, a*, and j flags and 0.
This can be achived by SELECT16 and one inverter for a output. Constants 1 and 0 are also used.
