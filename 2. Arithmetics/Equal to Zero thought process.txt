Thought process: 

Equal to Zero

Should output 1 if and only if all bits in the input are 0.

============
Should output 1 if and only if all bits in the input are 0.
We can OR input bits pair by pair until we get OR of all bits. The result will be 0 only if all input bits are 0, otherwise 1.
At the and we just negate the result to obtain and indicator 1-bit indicator for Equal To Zero input.
