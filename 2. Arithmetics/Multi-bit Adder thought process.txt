Thought process: 

First stage full-adder adds LSB bits and the input carry.
Next stage full-adder adds next bits togheter with output carry from the first full-adder stage.
And so on until all bits of input numbers are added.
The last stage full-adder provides the MSB and the total carry of the sum.
