Thought process: 

Selector

A select-component selects one out of two input bits for output.

The s (select) bit indicates which input is selected: If 0, d0 is selected, if 1, d1 is selected.

Input	Output
s	d1	d0	
0	0	0	0	
0	1	0	0	
0	0	1	1	
0	1	1	1	
1	0	0	0	
1	0	1	0	
1	1	0	1	
1	1	1	1	

============================

out = (NOT(s) AND d0) OR (s  AND d1)

By appliyng DeMorgan's law one obtains:

out = ((NOT s) NAND d0) NAND (s NAND d1)

Only 4 NAND gates.
