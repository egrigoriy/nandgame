Thought process: 

RAM

Build a memory unit with two 16-bit registers which is addressable and writable using a one-bit address.

Input
ad (address) indicates which storage unit we are accessing.

st (store) indicates if we want to write to the unit.

If 1, the value on X is stored in the unit.
If 0, then X is ignored.
X (data) is a 16-bit value.

cl (clock signal) synchronizes state changes. X is stored when cl=0, but emitted only when cl changes to 1.

Output
The value currently stored in the unit addressed by ad.

The easiest part is the reading from RAM. We can use SELECT16 to select the register to read from.

When writing to RAM we also need to select the register to write to.
This can be achived by routing the st (store) RAM input to the correct register.
This can be achived by using a SWITCH where the select output is defined by the address input.
