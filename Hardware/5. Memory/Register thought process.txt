Thought process: 

Register

A 2-bit DFF component works like a data flip-flop, except two bits (d1 and d0) are stored and emitted instead of one.
As cl changes to 0 again event is the trigger to send out the stored data, then an inverter must be used to feed cl to the selector.

We can just use 2 DFF in paraller each per input bit.
