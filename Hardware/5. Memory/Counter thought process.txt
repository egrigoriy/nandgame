Thought process: 
Counter

A counter component increments a 16-bit number for each clock cycle.

If st (store) is 1, then the input value X is used as the new counter value.

If st is 0, then the previous counter value is incremented with 1.

The counter output changes when cl (clock signal) changes to 0.

Input	Effect
st	cl	
0	0	set next to output + 1
1	0	set next to X
output is the current output of the component. next becomes the current output when cl changes to 0.

We have a notion of next, so some sequential logic should be involved.
Two options: combinatory + sequential or sequential + combinatory logic.
In which order?
As we have "set next to output + 1/set next to X", then the sequential element must be last in order to provide the required output on next cycle.
This element can be just a register. 
However, the register has st and cl inputs and if evident about cl, but what should be connected to its st(store) input?
As we need to store the value on cl tick, then we feed cl also to st(store).
Thus, on cl we store value in this register and on the next cl we send it to out.
The data input of the register is selected between out+1 and X by the input st(store) of the chip.
So we need a SELECT16 chip, and a INC16 device to prepare out+1 value to be stored to the register.
