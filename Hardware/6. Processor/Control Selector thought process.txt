Thought process: 

Control Selector

The s flag selects one of the two sets of inputs for output.

Input	Output
s	R	a	d	*a	j
0	R0	a0 	d0 	*a0 j0
1	R1	a1	d1	*a1	j1
This is a simple component, but necessary for supporting different kinds of instructions in the CPU.

The solution is straightforward: SELECT16 for R and one SELECT for bits (a	d	*a	j)
