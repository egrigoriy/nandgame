Thought process: 

Computer

Build a computer by combining:

A control unit
Storage memory (RAM and registers)
A program memory unit (ROM).
A counter which keeps track of the current instruction address (called the "program counter" or PC).
A clock unit
The word at the PC address in the program memory is the I input to the control unit.

Each clock cycle changes the program counter depending on j:

If j=0, the program counter should advance with 1.

If j=1, the PC should be set to the value on A.
===

The most evident part is the ROM. 
Its Ad input must come from the COUNTER output and its output must go to the CONTROL UNIT Instruction (I) for decoding.
COUNTER input st-store is connected to CONTOL UNIT j flag (j=1). j for JUMP!!!!
The stored value X to the COUNTER is the  A-register value.
COUNTER done.\

CONTROL UNIT output flags a, d, *a are connected to the RAM input.
CONTROL UNIT output R (Result) of decoded instruction is fed to X input (data to store) of the RAM.
This allows CONTROL UNIT to signal RAM what and where to store.

RAM outputs are connected to the CONTROL UNIT respective inputs A, D and *A.
That's it!!! The computer is working!!!!
