Thought process: 
Combined Memory

The memory of the processor consists of two 16-bit registers called A and D, and a RAM unit.

The a, d, *a flags and the X input is used to update one or more of the registers.

Flag	
a	Write X to the A register
d	Write X to the D register
*a	Write X to RAM at the address given by the A register
The flags can be combined, so X is simultaneously written to multiple registers. If all three flags are 0, the X input is ignored.

cl is the clock signal.

Output	
A	The current value of the A register
D	The current value of the D register
*A	The current value in RAM at the address given by A the register

===
We have 2 registers (A and D) and a RAM.
Each dst bit is used as st(store) input to corresponding memory.
Outputs are connected to corresponding outputs of these memory devices.
RAM adressing is done by its Ad input connected to A-register output.
