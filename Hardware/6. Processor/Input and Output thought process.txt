Thought process: 

Input and Output

Connect a lamp and a button, so they can be accessed like a memory address.

Output to device

The lamp is controlled by bit 0 and 1 of X:

When bit 1 is 1, the lamp should get a signal on on. When bit 0 is 1, the lamp should get a signal on off.

Signals should be sent to the hardware when st (store) is 1 and cl (clock signal) is 1.

Input from device

The button state is shown in bit 15 of the component output.

When the button is pressed, bit 15 should be 1. When it is not pressed, it should be 0.

Input signals should be readable immediately

===
The data for Input and Output is exposed by the Computer through registers.
Input data is written to a register and the Computer can read it and use it.
In the same way, the output is exposed to external world by a register, which bits can command the device connected to the output.
