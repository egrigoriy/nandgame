Logic Unit

The two bit-flags op0 and op1 select which out of four operations are performed on the two 16-bit inputs X and Y.

op1	op0	output
0	0	X and Y
0	1	X or Y
1	0	X xor Y
1	1	invert X

We have 4 basic operations and we need to SELECT one of them using 2 bits (op1 and op0).

As the SELECT16 element has only 1 select input and 2 data inputs, we need to build a cascade.
We split operations on 2 groups and in the first level of the cascade, we use op0 to select the operation from the group to go to second level of cascade.
In the second level op1 is used to select which group's output to be delivered to outside.

Level 1: We split operations in 2 groups:
GROUP 1:
op0	output
0	X and Y
1	X or Y

GROUP 2:
op0	output
0	X xor Y
1	invert X

Level 2: op2 selects which group output to be delivered to outside. 

op1	op0	          output
0	GROUP1	X and Y | X or Y
1	GROUP2	X xor Y | invert X
