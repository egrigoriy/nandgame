Thought process: 

Condition

The three flags indicate three possible conditions for the number X:

Flag	Condition
lt	  Less than zero
eq	  Equal to zero
gt	  Greater than zero

If the condition for the input flags is true for given input number then output is 1.

The flags can be combined so:

Flags	    Output 1 when
lt	eq	gt	
0	0	0	Never
0	0	1	X > 0
0	1	0	X = 0
0	1	1	X ≥ 0
1	0	0	X < 0
1	0	1	X ≠ 0
1	1	0	X ≤ 0
1	1	1	Always

=======================
We have 2 components to test the input value: IsNeg (NG) and IsZero (ZR).

The simples solution is to multiply logicaly each flag with the test of the input value and add the obtained results.

out = (lt AND NG) OR (eq AND ZR) OR (gt AND (NOT (NG OR ZR)))

However, this brings us to a non optimal solution with 8 components (62 NAND gates in total).

By appliyng DeMorgan's laws one can reduce to optimal solution of 8 components (56 NAND gates in total).

out = ((lt NAND NG) AND (eq NAND ZR)) NAND (gt NAND (NG nor ZR)
