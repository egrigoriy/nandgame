Thought process: 

Arithmetic Unit

The two bit-flags op0, op1 determine which of the following four arithmetic operations are performed on the two 16-bit inputs X and Y:

op1	op0	output
0	0	X + Y
1	0	X - Y
0	1	X + 1
1	1	X - 1

One can observe that op0 selects second operand between Y and 1 and op2 selects the operation to perform between ADDITION and SUBSTRACTION.
Thus, we need 2 SELECTOR16 and ADD16 and SUB16, as value 1 as well.
The last one is obtained by inverting 0 single-bit.
