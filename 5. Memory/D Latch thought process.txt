Thought process: 

D Latch

A D Latch (data latch) component holds a single bit

When st (store) is 1, the value on d is held and emitted.

When st is 0, the value of d is ignored, and the previously held value is still emitted.

Input	Output
st	d		
1	0	0
1	1	1
0	1	Same as previous
0	0	Same as previous
The initial output (before st is set first time) is unspecified, i.e. any value is allowed.

The behaviour is very similar to a SELECT gate: we "select" an input value at d1 with st (store) input.
When st (store) = 0, we select the previous, so output is fed back to d0 input of the select gate.
