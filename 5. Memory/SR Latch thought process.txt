Thought process: 

SR Latch

A SR Latch (or set/reset-latch) component can hold a single bit output

s=1 (set) sets the output to 1.

r=1 (reset) sets the output to 0

When both s and r are 1, the output is unchanged, i.e. the previously set or reset value is still output.

Until the first set or reset signal, the output is undefined (i.e. any output is allowed).

The output when both inputs are 0 is also undefined.

Input	Output
s	r	
1	0	1
0	1	0
1	1	Previous output
0	0	Not used


The solution is a little bit tricky and I found it by chance and memory ;)

The obtain the effect of memory, we need to feed back somehow the output.
So, we couple 2 NAND games in a clever way.

When s=1 r does not impact the output, so the value is SET

Input	Output
s	r	
0	0	Not used
1	0	1
0	1	0
1	1	Previous output

When r=1 the output is reset.
 
Input	Output
s	r	
0	0	Not used
1	0	1
0	1	0
1	1	Previous output
