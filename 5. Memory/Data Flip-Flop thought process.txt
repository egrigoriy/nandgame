Thought process: 

Data Flip-Flop

The DFF (data flip-flop) component store and output one bit. The output does not update immediately when input changes. Changes happen in phases, timed by the cl (clock) signal flipping between 0 and 1:

cl=0
The input flags st and d can change in this stage.

cl=1
If st=1 when cl changes to 1, the current value of d is stored. The stored value is not yet output.

cl=0
When cl changes to 0 again, the previously stored value is output.

Effect of inputs when cl=1:

Input	Effect
st	d	
1	0	next = 0
1	1	next = 1
0	0	unchanged
0	1	unchanged
Output before the first store and clock-cycle is unspecified. Assume there will be no changes in input while cl=1.

===
As the output is delayed compared to the input store there should be 2 stages.

The first stage is composed of D-latch that stores the input data when cl=1 AND st=1.
The second stage must select between current state and the stored input data in the first stage D-latch.
As cl changes to 0 again event is the trigger to send out the stored data, then an inverter must be used to feed cl to the selector.
