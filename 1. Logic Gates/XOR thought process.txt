Thought process: 

a NAND b = NOT(a AND b)

XOR truth table:

a  | b  | out
---------------
0  | 0  |  0
0  | 1  |  1
1  | 0  |  1 
1  | 1  |  0

We can use double negation and try to express operations only in AND, NAND and NOT, using De Morgan's laws.


a XOR b = (a AND NOT(b)) OR (NOT(a) AND b) = 

NOT(NOT((a AND NOT(b)) OR (NOT(a) AND b)) = 

NOT((NOT(a AND NOT(b)) AND NOT(NOT(a) AND b)) = 

NOT((a NAND NOT(b)) AND (NOT(a) NAND b) =

(a NAND NOT(b)) NAND (NOT(a) NAND b)
