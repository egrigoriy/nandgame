Thought process: 

Nand

Your task is to connect inputs to output through wires and relays such that when both a and b inputs are 1, the output is 0.

1 represents electrical current, 0 represents no current.

The V input carries constant current, i.e. always 1.

The exact specification:

Input	Output
a	b	
0	0	1
0	1	1
1	0	1
1	1	0

=====================


From NAND truth table one can observe that in most cases output seems insensible to a and b. 
Thus, it is resonable to forward to the output the power(always 1) with a relay (default on).
However, this relay out must be set to 0 when a and b are 1.
This can be achieved by setting in such a case its c-input to 1.
We can see from relay (default off) truth table, that we can this element as logic AND gate.

relay (default on) truth table:
in  | c  | out
---------------
0   | 0  |  0
0   | 1  |  0
1   | 0  |  1 // default on
1   | 1  |  0

relay (default off) truth table:
in  | c  | out
---------------
0   | 0  |  0 // default off
0   | 1  |  0 // default off
1   | 0  |  0 // default off
1   | 1  |  1
