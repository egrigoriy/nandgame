Thought process: 

NAND truth table:

a  | b  | out
---------------
0  | 0  |  1
0  | 1  |  1
1  | 0  |  1 
1  | 1  |  0

From NAND truth table one can observe that out is 0 when a and b are both 1, and out is 1 when a and b are both 0.
Thus, 2 input gate can be used as NOT if level to be inverted is fed to both NAND inputs.
