Thought process: 

OR truth table:

a  | b  | out
---------------
0  | 0  |  0
0  | 1  |  1
1  | 0  |  1 
1  | 1  |  1

We can use double negation and try to express operations only in AND, NAND and NOT, using De Morgan's laws.

a OR b = NOT(NOT(a OR b)) = NOT(NOT(a) AND NOT(b)) = NOT(a) NAND NOT(b)
