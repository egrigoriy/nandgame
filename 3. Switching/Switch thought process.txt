Thought process: 

Switch

A switch component channels a data bit through one of two output channels.

s (selector) determines if the d (data) bit is dispatched through c1 or c0.

Input	Output
s	d	c1	c0
0	0	0	0	
0	1	0	1	
1	0	0	0	
1	1	1	0	

===========================

A switch component channels a data bit through one of two output channels.

s (selector) determines if the d (data) bit is dispatched through c1 or c0.

Thus, by DeMorgan's laws:

c0 = (NOT s) AND d = (s NAND d) AND d         (material conditional)
c1 = s AND d = NOT (s NAND d)

Signal (s NAND d) is reused. The result is ONLY 4 NAND gates
